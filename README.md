# Portfolio-Website-Practice
Creating a portfolio website for class project to meet project requirements.

This project is developed as an educational project. Certain materials are included under the fair use exemption of the U.S. Copyright Law and have been prepared according to the multimedia fair use guidelines and are restrited from further use.

Learned about half of the project by learning through YouTube. Learning through YouTube tutorials and googling stackoverflow questions are very fun and helps me learn outside of class to practice. 

With this project I was able to display my knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a little bit of XML and JSON.
